# EV-Data-Logging-and-Fault-Detection-with-InfluxDB-Python-GUI
Built an end-to-end vehicle data simulator and analyzer using InfluxDB and Python. Simulated EV telemetry like SOC, temperature, faults, and pushed it to InfluxDB. Created a Tkinter GUI to retrieve, analyze, and detect issues like low SOC, high temp, and charger faults.
